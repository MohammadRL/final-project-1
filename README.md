# final-project-1
##### This Project shows my own general and quick view about how to read the dataset and try to understand it's features.
## Project Headlines:
### Importing the libraries:
At first step I imported the most used libraries in this project, but in next steps I needed some more libraries so I imported it in a late stage.
### Cleaning Data:
I tried to find the most common ways to clean the data so I looked for duplicated raws and missing data with null values and mark it's ratio of all data , and finally I decided to drop raws which contained one or more null values.
### EDA:
For exploring data I showed the correlation matrix to find the correlation between features.
### Data Preprocessing:
In this stage I dropped unnecessary features, encoded the target to one and zero, scaled the data to be between zero and one,split the data to train,evaluate, and test data, and finally balanced the training data.
### Model Training and Evaluation:
I built a fully connected sequential model and trained on the training data.
I plotted the accuracy and loss to show performance of the model.
Finally, I evaluated the model using precision, recall, and accuracy.
